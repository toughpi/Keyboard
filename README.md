# Keyboard
Keyboard part of the project
We want to use those now really cheap cf-29 toughbook, get rid of the motherboard and replace it by a Pi4 and build a custom motherboard to old everything in place and keep all the ports operational.
Challenges: theire is no lcd controller made for those, we will have to find a open one and program it.
  Same for the keyboard, I am building a custom connector trough a pro trinket to make it usb.
  
  We are looking for programmers - electronic engineers to help us out.
